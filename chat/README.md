# Chat Service

The chat service is an example Micro service which leverages bidirectional streaming, the store and events to build a chat backend. There is both a server and client which can be run together to demonstrate the application (see client/main.go for more instructions on running the service).

The service is documented inline and is designed to act as a reference for the events package.
